# You're probably not going mad, just check your use of that pesky second parameter

## Setting the scene
Currently at React Europe and between scenes I was working on a chat interface in React Native that connects to AWS Lex. I encountered a fun bug, where the message typed by the user was rendering very briefly, only to be mysteriously whisked away again when the response came back from Lex and the message was supposedly appended to the array of sent and received messages.

## The broken code

```javascript
const appendMessage = ({ message, from }) => {
  setMessages(oldMessages => [...oldMessages, { message, from }]);
  if (from === "me") {
    sendToLex(message);
  }
};
```

For a little context - this function takes in an object which contains a message and the sender (either 'me', or 'bot'). If `from` is set to `me` then the `message` is sent to Lex as well as being set in the component's state.

## The fix
Okay, so first thing is to actuall _read_ the [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate). That doesn't mean opening it and scrolling for a bit, but actually reading it. If I'd done this, i'd have  spotted:

> Functional updates
> If the new state is computed using the previous state, you can pass a function to setState. The function will receive the previous value, and return an updated value. Hereâ€™s an example of a counter component that uses both forms of `setState`:

Ah. So by simply changing
```javascript
setMessages([...messages, { message, from }]);
```

to

```javascript
setMessages(oldMessages => [...oldMessages, { message, from }]);
```

This now works, producing the following behaviour

That's all there is to it. This is analagous to the 'old' way of setting state using:

```javascript
this.setState(oldState => ({ value: oldState.value }))
```
